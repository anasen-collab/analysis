# Silicon Relative Calibration
The signals from each detector mush be gain-matched relative to one another so that the group of signals from each detector are self consistent.
The principle behind the relative calibration is the same for both the QQQ and SX3 detector types, but the SX3 detectors require additional relative calibration for the position signals.

## Requirements
The relative calibration of the silicon detectors is performed after the pulser calibration has been applied.

### QQQ
The macros for calibrating the QQQ detectors are located in [QQQ](QQQ).
There are four QQQ detectors in total; detector numbers 0-3.
### SX3
The macros for calibrating the SX3 detectors are located in [SX3](SX3).
There are 24 SX3 detectors in two rings of 12; detector numbers 4-15 in Ring 1 and detectors 16-27.
