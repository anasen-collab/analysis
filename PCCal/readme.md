# ANASEN proportional counter (PC) calibration
The PC is made up of 24 wires. Each wire is read out from each end of the detector, for a total of 48 signals. This requires at least three 16-channel preamplifers and at least one-and-a-half 32-channel ADCs. The calibration of the PC signals is accomplished in three steps as enumerated below.
 
## Order of calibration
 1. Pulser calibration
 2. Realative calibration
 3. Position calibration

## Pulser calibration
The macros for calibrating the voltage of the PC are located in [PulserCal](PulserCal).
## Realative calibration
The macros for calibrating the gain matching of the PC are located in [RelativeCal](RelativeCal).
## Position calibration
The macros for calibrating the voltage of the PC are located in [PositionCal](PositionCal).
